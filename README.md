A pure-python derivatives pricing library.


### Mission statement

Disquant is an educational derivatives pricing library. It is not intended for production use and prioritizes 
code readability over performance.

Disquant is built around the following principles:

1. Pure Python: does not depend on any C or C++ extension
2. Modern Python: the project started with Python 3.12 and uses modern Python features
3. Pythonic: the coding style embraces Pythonic implementations
4. PEP-8 / black compliant: it's just easier for everybody to read
